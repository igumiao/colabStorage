    "In this notebook, we'll be building bigram *n*-gram language models from scratch. The first part of building a language model is collecting counts from corpora. We'll do some preprocessing first, by lowercasing everything and add `<s>` (start) and `</s>` (end) symbols at the beginning and end of each sentence. For bigrams, we are using dictionaries of dictionaries with the strings as keys, which is a convenient though not particularly memory efficient way to represent things. We will use the unigram counts later for doing smoothing."

    "Generally, we can see some local coherence but most of these sentences are complete nonsense. Across the two corpora, the sentences are noticeably different, it's very obvious that the model from Project Gutenberg is trained on literature, whereas the Penn Treebank data is financial. For the latter, there are some strange tokens (those starting with \\*) we should probably have filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using language models to generate sentences is fun but not very useful. A more practical application is the ability to assign a probability to a sentence. In order to do that for anything but toy examples, however, we will need to smooth our models so it doesn't assign a zero probability to the sentence whenever it sees a bigram. Here, we'll test two fairly simple smoothing techniques, add-*k* smoothing and interpolated smoothing. In both cases, we will calculate the log probability, to avoid working with very small numbers. The functions below give the probability for a single word at index i in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that interpolation is implemented using 3 probabilities: the bigram, the unigram and a \"zerogram\" probability. The \"zerogram\" actually refers to the probability of any word appearing. We need this extra probability in order to account for out-of-vocabulary (OOVs) words, which result in zero probability for both bigrams and unigrams. Estimating the probability of OOVs is a general problem: here we use an heuristic that uses a uniform distribution over all words in the vocabulary (1 / |V|)."
